  <p class="teaser">The Second International System Administration and
  Network Engineering
  Conference (SANE 2000) took place from 22-25 May 2000 at the
  Maastricht Exhibition and Conference Centre (MECC) in the
  Netherlands. More than five hundred delegates from twenty-seven
  countries descended on the MECC for the conference, organized by
  the <a href="http://www.nluug.nl/">Netherlands UNIX User
  Group</a> and co-sponsored by <a href=
  "http://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> and <a href=
  "http://www.nlnet.nl/">Stichting NLnet</a>.</p>

  <p>The conference was preceded by two tutorial days, with topics
  including <a href="http://www.sendmail.com/">Sendmail</a>
  configuration, delivered by Eric Allman, author of Sendmail;
  IPSEC and FreeS/WAN, by Hugh Daniel of the <a href=
  "http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeswan/">Linux FreeS/WAN project</a>;
  DNS administration, by Jim Reid of <a href=
  "http://www.nominum.com/">Nominum</a>; and firewall technologies,
  by Jos Vos of <a href="http://www.xos.nl/">X/OS Experts in Open
  Systems</a>.</p>

  <p>The main conference began with a <a href=
  "http://pa.bell-labs.com/~bkreid/sane2000/">keynote address</a>
  from Brian Reid of Bell Labs, entitled <em>Blame Allocation: the
  key to successful system administration in a world in which
  absolutely everyone uses the Internet and absolutely no one is in
  charge</em>. He discussed administrative boundaries: with many
  entities involved in information delivery (particularly with the
  advent of wireless Internet and WAP phones) there are many
  boundaries and you have no control over other people's systems.
  Who do you blame when something goes wrong? The lazy solution is
  to buy everything from one vendor, but this brings its own
  problems: computer viruses; license fees; implementations not
  conforming to standards or subject to public review; monopoly
  plans not consistent with your own.</p>

  <p>He also had some interesting ideas on infrastructure for
  information delivery: maybe one day we will all have a data meter
  in our homes just like we now have an electricity meter.
  Telephone, Internet, and television will all come down the same
  wire, with different companies competing for our custom and
  delivering over the same physical channel - as is happening now
  with the power utilities.</p>

  <p>Another of his messages was that good marketing can sell bad
  software: sometimes the name is everything. We should use a
  single brand name to stand for "not controlled by a monopoly."
  Will Linux and FreeBSD find a way to combine forces?</p>

  <p>After the keynote the conference split into two main streams
  of technical presentations with additional BoF (Birds of a
  Feather) and WiP (Work in Progress) sessions.</p>

  <p>The first technical session I attended was <em>Confining the
  Omnipotent Root</em> by Poul-Henning Kamp of the FreeBSD project.
  He talked about the FreeBSD jail facility that allows an
  administrator to partition the system into separate virtual
  machines, or "jails." Management capabilities for each virtual
  machine environment can be delegated, but a privileged user in a
  jail cannot affect the parts of the system outside their virtual
  machine. This is a very useful feature for ISPs and the like who
  offer virtual hosting. During questions at the end, Malcolm
  Beattie pointed out that the FreeBSD jails are a special case of
  the "compartments" element of MAC (Mandatory Access Control) that
  he has <a href=
  "http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/linux-kernel.html">implemented</a>
  for the Linux kernel.</p>

  <p>The next two technical sessions concerned cryptography:
  <em>How to Ring a Swan</em> by Baastian Bakker; then
  <em>Architecture for Secure Multicast Communications</em> by
  R&uuml;diger Weis. Baastian's talk covered methods for storing
  private key information on an <a href=
  "http://www.ibutton.com/ibuttons/">iButton</a> device, rather
  than in a configuration file, while R&uuml;diger talked about
  adding security (strong cryptography, real-time streaming, and
  reliability) to multicast applications, based on OpenPGP and RTP
  (Real-time Transport Protocol). These talks are described in
  detail in the conference proceedings.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon I attended the Linux High-Availability BoF
  session. Alan Robertson talked about the goals of the <a href=
  "http://www.linux-ha.org/">High-Availability Linux project</a>:
  <em>...to provide a high-availability (clustering) solution for
  Linux which promotes reliability, availability, and
  serviceability (RAS) through a community development effort</em>.
  He discussed software that is currently available, and things
  planned for the future - which include a port of SGI's FailSafe
  to Linux. This was not a formal presentation and there was some
  audience interaction, as well as some disagreement! This session
  was of particular interest to me as my job includes
  administration of the Linux cluster, <a href=
  "http://users.ox.ac.uk/~mbeattie/herald-ukuug99.ps">Herald</a>,
  that provides mail store and web-based email access to staff and
  students at Oxford University.</p>

  <p>The final technical session of the day was <em>Bastille Linux:
  Security Through Transparency</em>, presented by Jon Lasser of
  the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). Jon was
  hired by UMBC to tackle the problems of Linux spreading rapidly
  throughout the University network: Linux is easy to install, but
  hard to administer (securely). An environment with inexperienced
  administrators, applying security updates infrequently (if at
  all), lead to wide-open systems and frequent break-ins. Bastille
  Linux was originally intended to be a Linux distribution that
  improved security over existing distributions. Instead, a
  hardening script (based on the RedHat distribution) was
  developed. More information about Bastille Linux is available
  from their <a href="http://bastille-linux.sourceforge.net/">home
  page</a>.</p>

  <p>In the evening came the conference social event, held at
  <em>La Bonbonni&egrave;re</em> in the centre of Maastricht. This
  included free pinball; live music from <em>The Konkoma Maximum
  Love Open Source Software Orchestra</em> - a salsa band dressed
  as penguins; plenty of food and drink; and the American comedy
  act Boom Chicago! In the Netherlands, beer is served in 1/3 litre
  glasses with a large head, and on hearing that I was English (or
  perhaps prompted by my frequent appearance at the bar) one of the
  staff commented that I must find their beer glasses very
  small!</p>

  <p>The second conference day began with Thomas Fehr, co-author of
  YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) and one of the founders of <a href=
  "http://www.suse.de/">SuSE Linux</a>, discussing automated
  installation (and configuration) of Linux. This was another talk
  of particular interest to me: I haven't looked closely at any of
  the automated tools before, but have been prompted me to take
  another look at RedHat's kickstart utility.</p>

  <p>Next came two talks on packet filtering. The first covered
  <a href="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/">IP Filter</a>, a
  packet-filtering engine available for *BSD and Solaris. This was
  a technical (but interesting!) talk concentrating on the new
  state engine in IP Filter. The second discussed a new, rule-based
  interface to the Linux kernel for packet filtering, which enables
  implementation of flexible, fine-grained firewall rules.
  Development moves quickly in the Linux world, and while the first
  pre-release of the 2.4 kernel has just been announced, the
  author's patches are against 2.0.34. The example given in the
  talk (of firewalling an FTP server) was of a policy that would be
  better implemented by the FTP daemon. Again, details of these two
  talks appear in the conference proceedings.</p>

  <p>After lunch was a talk by Mark Burgess of Oslo College,
  <em>Evaluation of cfengine's immunity model of system
  maintenance</em>. The author pointed out that his interest was
  primarily academic: cfengine was developed to help study system
  administration and not as a practical tool (although some people
  find it useful). As the title promised, the presentation
  concentrated on the "immunity model" and I left the talk still
  not knowing what cfengine might do to help me in the job of
  system maintenance!</p>

  <p>This was followed by <em>Deploying (and Developing) Free
  Software for Network Administration</em>, a talk by Alexios
  Zevras of Athens University. He described two projects he had
  been involved in: Cordial, a system for administration of a
  dial-up access service; and an as-yet unnamed system for
  monitoring and reporting the status of various servers and
  services. He described some of the advantages of custom software
  over the commercial alternatives (focussed functionality and
  familiarity of administrators) and of component-based systems
  over all-encompassing (hence very large) software solutions.</p>

  <p>One of the most entertaining technical talks came at the end
  of the second day: <em>Crypto Blunders</em> by Steve Burnett of
  RSA Security Inc. Steve described some of the mistakes people
  have made over the years in their use of cryptography: putting a
  back door into the product; implementing the algorithm
  incorrectly; using a one-time pad more than once. The talk was
  spiced with amusing anecdotes and the presenter didn't shy away
  from pointing the finger (although he has promised some of those
  concerned that this will be the last time they are
  mentioned).</p>

  <p>It wasn't possible to attend every session, but they were all
  recorded on video and available for viewing throughout the
  conference. Sessions I missed included: <em><a href=
  "http://www.netrack.net/sane2000/tsld001.htm">Wireless Internet
  delivery</a>; Future directions of Sendmail; Cricket (Web TV);
  <a href="http://www.nfsv4.org/">NFS version 4</a>; Modern file
  systems and storage; An experimental tool for visual data mining;
  DNS-SEC; <a href="http://www.nntp.sol.net/sane2000/">Usenet news
  system</a></em>. There was also a vendor exhibition where
  hardware and software vendors, support services, Linux
  distributors and booksellers displayed their wares.</p>

  <p>The conference closed with thank you speeches to the
  organizers, volunteers, and speakers, and an award for best paper
  given to Brian Pawlowski for his presentation on the NFS Version
  4 Protocol. Finally came the zany inSANE quiz, which got off the
  ground after some problems with a Perl script and X
  configuration. Quiz topics included assembler instructions; Monty
  Python; SCSI commands; cartoon characters; programming languages.
  Contestants bent their minds to questions such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What are the first names of K&amp;R?</li>

    <li>What type of parrot did John Cleese complain about?</li>

    <li>Which SCSI command locks a device for exclusive use?</li>

    <li>Who said "Real programmers can program assembler in any
    language"?</li>

    <li>Which chip does the assembler instruction HCF belong
    to?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The quiz master claimed to have all the answers in his
  head!</p>

  <p>As well as printed proceedings, T-shirts and other goodies
  were to be found in the conference packs. I wonder how many red
  faces were seen coming through airport security on the way home -
  the baggage checkers at Maastricht told us they'd found at least
  a dozen people with handcuffs in their bags: <em>security in a
  box</em> from <a href="http://www.tunix.nl/">tunix</a>.</p>

  <p>The MECC provided excellent facilities for the conference, and
  Maastricht the ideal setting - with good transport links,
  first-class hotels and restaurants, and - although served in
  small glasses - good beer! Everyone I encountered spoke excellent
  English, and I felt ashamed that I couldn't even say "thank you"
  in Dutch. The conference itself was well-organized and offered a
  good selection of talks, with something for (almost) everyone.
  Good attention was paid to detail, with a conference badge
  entitling you to free travel on the local buses. I'm looking
  forward to SANE III, which is planned for about eighteen months
  time. Perhaps by then I'll have learned some Dutch!</p>
