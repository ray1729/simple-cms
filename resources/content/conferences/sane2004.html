  <p class="teaser">September 30th 2004 saw the opening of the 4th International
  System Administration and Network Engineering Conference (SANE)
  at Amsterdam's RAI conference centre. The conference was
  organized by the Netherlands UNIX User Group (NLUUG),
  co-sponsored by Stichting NLnet, with cooperation from USENIX,
  the Advanced Computing Systems Association.</p>

  <p class="teaser">A SANE conference has been held every two years since the
  first was organized in 1998 "...to strengthen the European ties
  between the National UNIX User Groups and their members", in the
  spirit of the former EUUG/EurOpen. I had attended SANE 2000, held
  in Maastricht, so was delighted to receive an invitation from
  NLUUG to represent UKUUG at SANE 2004.</p>

  <p>The conference itself was preceded by three days of tutorials
  - a very strong programme with five parallel streams throughout
  the three days. Topics ranged from networking (IPv6, firewalls,
  wireless, IP telephony), through operating systems (FreeBSD 5.2
  code walkthrough, Linux 2.6 process management), to popular
  applications (MySQL, Postfix, OpenLDAP, Samba). Every SANE
  conference has also featured a Black Hats Session, which is
  obviously popular: this year's ("Black Hats Session IV:
  Developments in Security") was run on Monday and repeated on
  Tuesday.</p>

  <p>Work pressures prevented me from attending the tutorials, but
  I arrived at RAI on Wednesday evening just as Richard Stallman
  was finishing his presentation, "The Danger of Software Patents".
  Stallman had travelled to Amsterdam earlier in the day and joined
  in the demonstration for innovation without software patents held
  in Amsterdam's Dam Square. The demonstration was organized to
  coincide with a high-level EU conference on future ICT policy in
  Europe (initiated by the Dutch government in their 2004
  Presidency of the EU), also being held in Amsterdam. Enough
  politics (for now).</p>

  <p>Wednesday evening also saw the SANE Free Software Bazaar, a
  free event open to non-delegates. Here you could meet and chat
  informally with developers from the Debian project, OpenBSD,
  FreeBSD, CAcert, and many others. Birds-of-a-feather sessions
  covering Samba, KDE, MMBase, KeyWorx, and VIM were also held on
  Wednesday evening.</p>

  <p>The conference proper started on Thursday morning with a
  keynote by Paul Kilmartin of eBay, Inc, "eBay through the eyes of
  the Systems Administrator". This was a very interesting talk
  about the challenges of managing the IT infrastructure behind a
  (rapidly) growing company, where downtime means losing real money
  (eBay currently transacts business worth more than USD
  1000/second). The most important point I came away with was this:
  when you are planning for high availability, you do not want to
  be at the bleeding edge, you want to be doing what other HA sites
  are doing. Unfortunately for eBay, this is not always possible:
  they are, after all, one of the world's largest online
  retailers.</p>

  <p>Another important point from Kilmartin's talk was that they
  are never under the illusion of having solved a problem: while a
  new system might handle today's workload, eBay's growth is such
  that the lifetime of any solution is strictly limited. Kilmartin
  ended his talk with a section entitled "Why I Hate Vendors".
  Anyone who has dealt with a vendor support desk more interested
  in closing a trouble ticket than actually solving a problem will
  have a lot of sympathy with him.</p>

  <p>After the keynote, the conference split into two streams:
  refereed papers, and invited speakers. I stayed with the invited
  speakers for the rest of the morning.</p>

  <p>The first of these was Arjen Lentz of MySQL AB, with "MySQL
  Roadmap - What we have now and where we are heading". He covered
  some history of the MySQL project, their development procedures
  and release schedule, and MySQL's current (and planned) features.
  Whenever he was talking about a feature, he said a few words
  about the developer behind it: their background, where they are
  in the world, and how they came to be involved with the project.
  This added a personal dimension to what might otherwise have been
  a dull list of features, and also emphasized the global bazaar
  nature of MySQL development.</p>

  <p>Next was Wietse Venema's "Open Source Security Lessons". He
  began his talk with some history, taking us back to the time when
  Eindhoven University in the Netherlands was first connected to
  the Internet. One "unofficial" user of their systems was causing
  problems for system administrators: they cleaned up after their
  activities with "rm -rf /". In an effort to track down this
  intruder, Venema wrote the first version of what we now know as
  "TCP wrappers".</p>

  <p>He went on to talk about the press response to his and Dan
  Farmer's release of SATAN, the network security vulnerability
  scanner: "It's like distributing high-powered rocket launchers
  throughout the world, free of charge, available at your local
  library or school" (San Jose Mercury). As it turned out, the
  release of SATAN did not result in an increase in reports of
  computer break-in activity, and SATAN proved a useful addition to
  the system administrator's toolbox for many years.</p>

  <p>He then talked about Postfix, and the role its release had in
  bringing open source software to the attention of IBM's senior
  management. Finally, he came to the debate about open versus
  closed source software and security, where he thinks the
  protagonists are missing the point: "...when a system isn't built
  to be secure, then it will be like Swiss cheese no matter how
  many security patches you apply". He pointed out that this is not
  a new insight, and quoted a 30-year-old paper saying essentially
  the same thing.</p>

  <p>After lunch, I moved to the other lecture room for the
  refereed papers: "Lambda Networking in NetherLight" by Erik
  Radius of SURFnet; then "Traffic shaping for large-scale web
  services" by Angelos Varvitsiotis of the Greek Research and
  Technology Network.</p>

  <p>The first of these was a technical talk about using different
  wavelengths of light (lambdas) to transmit multiple data channels
  over a single optical fibre (dense wavelength division
  multiplexing). As well as the technical aspects, Radius talked
  about NetherLight's global connectivity (which includes StarLight
  in Chicago, and UKLight in London), and potential uses for the
  technology (for example, high-bandwidth GRID computing).</p>

  <p>From high bandwidth to low: Varvitsiotis's talk was about
  traffic shaping for web servers with an uplink bottleneck. He
  used an Apache module, <code>mod_mimetos</code>, to set the IP
  type-of-service value according to the MIME type, file size,
  directory, etc. of the content being delivered, in conjunction
  with a class-based queuing (CBQ) scheme and a set of filters to
  map ToS values to particular queues, implemented using the Linux
  kernel's advanced routing and traffic control mechanisms. He also
  updated Apache's <code>mod_mime_magic</code> module to bring it
  into line with the latest "file" code.</p>

  <p>Varvitsiotis then used data gathered from his University's
  cache logs to generate driver data for a simulation, and ran
  different workloads against an uplink-throttled web server. The
  results of these experiments are detailed in his paper.</p>

  <p>The next refereed paper, "TCG 1.2 - fair play with the Fritz
  chip?", was presented by Rudiger Weis of Vrije University. This
  was an entertaining (but nevertheless worrying) look at the
  latest proposal from Microsoft and other members of the Trusted
  Computing Group (TCG).</p>

  <p>The concept of trusted computing is to place an especially
  trusted observer, or "Fritz chip", into information-handling
  devices, to prevent even the device owner from carrying out
  certain operations: the owner gives up some control of their
  device in return for the ability to verify a device's
  "trustworthiness".</p>

  <p>While the proposed architecture will offer only limited
  protection against worms and viruses, it offers a lot of features
  that can be used to protect a personal computer against its
  owner, especially in the field of Digital Restrictions Management
  (in the words of Ron Rivest, "...you are putting a virtual
  set-top box inside your PC. You are essentially renting out part
  of your PC to people you may not trust").</p>

  <p>Cryptographers and privacy organizations have pressurized the
  TCG into modifying their proposals, and the recent TCG 1.2
  specification does address some of their concerns. There are,
  however, still worries about backdoors, potential compatibility
  problems between Trusted Computing and Free (GPL-licensed)
  Software, and patent issues (an official Microsoft statement
  reads "...Much of the next-generation secure computing base
  architecture design is covered by patents, and there will be
  intellectual property issues to be resolved. It is too early to
  speculate on how those issues might be addressed.").</p>

  <p>The final talk of the day was a choice between the invited
  speaker, John Nelson on "Special Effects on the Movie 'I, Robot'
  ", and Clifford Wolf's refereed paper on "Distributed Software
  Development using Subversion and SubMaster". I opted for the
  latter.</p>

  <p>Some of you will already know Clifford Wolf as the project
  leader for ROCK Linux. Just over a year ago, the ROCK Linux
  project decided to switch from CVS to Subversion. In the first
  half of his talk, Wolf covered the basics of revision control
  systems and introduced Subversion itself. He then moved on to
  discuss SubMaster, and it was here that the talk started to get
  interesting.</p>

  <p>Like CVS, Subversion is a centralized revision control system,
  where only privileged project members have commit access to a
  central repository. Other developers must submit patches via a
  mailing list, where they can easily be overlooked.</p>

  <p>SubMaster, developed by the ROCK Linux project, is an attempt
  to address this problem and provide for a distributed development
  model. SubMaster provides scripts that make it easy for
  developers to create and manage their own branches (in their own
  local Subversion repository), keep them synchronized with the
  central repository, and send patches upstream. It also provides a
  CGI script to manage patch submission, collect feedback, make
  regression tests, and apply patches to the main tree.</p>

  <p>But a conference is about more than just technical talks, and
  SANE is no exception. There are opportunities to chat informally
  with peers during the refreshment breaks, but there's nothing
  like being thrown together on a boat with an unlimited supply of
  beer to break the ice.</p>

  <p>The SANE 2004 social event on Thursday evening began as
  something of a mystery tour, with three "bendy buses" setting off
  across the city, attempting a three-point turn on a dual
  carriageway, then dropping us in the middle of nowhere. After a
  short walk through a residential then industrial area, we arrived
  at a boat yard and boarded a boat for the evening's cruise.
  Entertainment was provided by the Bucket Big Band (I counted
  seven saxophones, a clarinet, trombone, two trumpets, two
  guitars, a drummer, and a very energetic conductor). As well as
  unlimited drinks, a buffet provided plenty of Indonesian food,
  making for a very enjoyable evening. Better still, by the time we
  docked, the bus drivers had found the boat yard, so there was no
  need to repeat the walk.</p>

  <p>The first invited speaker on Friday morning was Geoff Halprin
  of The SysAdmin Group, with "The Changing Face of System
  Administration". Halprin discussed the challenges facing
  modern-day system administrators and the often conflicting
  priorities: troubleshooting, user support, infrastructure
  projects, keeping our skills up-to-date. He stressed the
  importance (to system administrators as well as managers) of
  measuring how much time is spent on each of task, and of
  maintaining the correct balance (learning and infrastructure
  projects should not lose out to short-term objectives).</p>

  <p>I switched to the refereed papers stream for the next two
  talks, "High Available Loadsharing with OpenBSD" by Marco
  Pfatschbacher, then "Deployment of Worldwide IDS Networks" by
  Matthias Hofherr. Both of these speakers work for GeNUA mbH, a
  German IT security consultancy.</p>

  <p>Pfatschbacher presented a paper describing work carried out as
  part of his diploma thesis about High Availability VPNs. In a
  traditional load balancing setup, the load balancer is a single
  point of failure unless a second, redundant, load balancer is
  introduced. As with many HA solutions, this introduces extra
  complexity. Pfatschbacher came up with a nifty idea to provide HA
  and load balancing without this complexity.</p>

  <p>He implemented a new kind of network interface in OpenBSD, a
  virtual Ethernet interface, or veif. The veif can be assigned an
  arbitrary MAC address, effectively providing two network
  interface cards in one. Thus two hosts on the same network can
  share a common MAC and IP address without changing the MAC
  addresses of their physical interfaces. Each host remains
  individually addressable, while packets sent to the common
  address are seen by both hosts.</p>

  <p>Of course, this presents problems on a switched network, so
  his next trick is to make a switch behave like a hub. To achieve
  this, veif never sends any packets with its virtual MAC as a
  source address (think proxy ARP), so the switch never learns the
  whereabouts of the common MAC address.</p>

  <p>The next step is to ensure that, although all packets are seen
  by both hosts, each packet is only processed by one host.
  Pfatschbacher introduced an option to OpenBSD's pf to filter
  packets based on a hash of the source and destination IP
  addresses and ports. One host is configured to drop all packets
  in one half of the hash space, and the other host to drop all
  packets in the opposite half.</p>

  <p>OpenBSD 3.5 introduced support for CARP (Common Address
  Redundancy Protocol), which utilizes virtual MAC addresses to
  enable multiple machines on the same local network to share a set
  of IP addresses, while ensuring that these addresses are always
  available. Pfatschbacher used CARP for monitor and failover of
  the pf-hash configuration: if one host fails, its hash range is
  migrated to one of the remaining CARP hosts.</p>

  <p>In the next talk, "Deployment of worldwide IDS networks",
  Hofherr presented a case study featuring a fictional company,
  BigCorp, who wanted to employ a network intrusion detection
  system in their offices across the globe.</p>

  <p>Hofherr described a hierarchical solution, with IDS sensors
  analyzing traffic and generating alerts that are fed upstream to
  a "Central". The sensors and the central communicate over a
  dedicated management network, both to lessen the burden on the
  production network, and to reduce the likelihood of an attacker
  analyzing the IDS data. The solution was based on the open source
  IDS Snort, with a central server running PostgreSQL.
  Administration is over https to an Apache server, using client
  certificates for authentication.</p>

  <p>Hofherr discussed the different possibilities for traffic
  capture, their chosen solution (Ethernet Tap devices), the
  problems this introduced for Snort (and how they solved them),
  and the protocol for communication between the sensors and
  central servers. He also discussed security, availability, and
  monitoring of the IDS infrastructure itself.</p>

  <p>He concludes that, although installation of a single network
  intrusion detection system is well understood and documented,
  implementing a distributed IDS presents new problems. While there
  are no out-of-the-box open source solutions, the software
  components do exist and the challenge is in coming up with a
  robust, secure, and conclusive design.</p>

  <p>A meeting of national Unix User Group board members had been
  called for Friday lunchtime. The Netherlands (NLUUG), Norway
  (NUUG), Denmark (DKUUG), United Kingdom (UKUUG), and Croatia
  (HrOpen) were all represented here. Discussion focused on how the
  national groups might work together, for example, reciprocal
  agreements enabling members to attend national UUG events at the
  local members' rate. DKUUG is planning to revitalize the defunct
  EUUG/EurOpen and put the content of old EUUG magazines online,
  and NUUG has digital video footage of some of its talks
  available.</p>

  <p>It was interesting to meet with the other UUG board members
  and to see the common challenges we are facing. The meeting
  engendered an excellent spirit of cooperation, and I came away
  feeling quite optimistic. The challenge remains in turning ideas
  into concrete actions, and following through on those
  actions.</p>

  <p>I returned to the invited speakers for the remainder of the
  conference. This stream started off after lunch with a talk on
  "Dutch Law Enforcement vs High Tech Crime" by Pascal Hetzscholdt,
  a policy advisor to the Dutch National Police Agency. Hetzscholdt
  is currently involved in setting up a High Tech Crime Centre in
  the Netherlands.</p>

  <p>He talked about the challenges faced by the police in tackling
  the new "cyber crime", and the links between high tech crime
  (phishing, fraud) and organized gangs often involved in drug
  trafficking and arms trading. These links can make it hard to
  decide which agency should tackle the problem: fraud
  investigators, because of the financial aspects of phishing?
  "cybercops" for their technical expertise? drug enforcement
  agencies when the money is used for drug trafficing?</p>

  <p>Fighting IT crime is not seen as a "cool thing" - sitting in
  front of a computer screen is not as exciting as a high-speed car
  chase. And shouldn't priority be given to more shocking crimes
  like murder, rape, kidnapping? In the Netherlands, these
  priorities are decided by the public prosecutor who often does
  not recognize the significance of computer crime, but knows that
  it can be costly to find the IT expertise required to fight
  it.</p>

  <p>Hetzscholdt appealed to the system administrators and Internet
  service providers in the audience for their help: the police need
  our expertise. But he was not given an easy time during audience
  questioning: many are unhappy with legal requirements imposed on
  ISPs to collect logs and data about their users activities and
  meet the costs of storing this for long periods of time.</p>

  <p>Next came my favourite talk of the conference, Sjoera Nas of
  Bits of Freedom on "The Multatuli Project: ISP Notice &amp; Take
  Down". Under the European directive on electronic commerce,
  Internet service providers risk liability for hosting apparently
  illegal content from their customers. This is quite different
  from the situation in the United States, where the DMCA provides
  a safe harbour for service providers.</p>

  <p>In 2003, three researchers from the Oxford Centre for
  Socio-Legal Studies conducted a small experiment with notice and
  take-down, to see if the different legal frameworks made any
  difference in practice. They published an article (an extract
  from John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty", about freedom of speech) on
  a homepage in the UK and one in the USA. This was clearly marked
  as dating from 1869, and belonging to the public domain.</p>

  <p>They then sent a fake complaint to the two ISPs, using an
  anonymous Hotmail address. The UK provider removed the homepage
  within 24 hours, while the US provider insisted that the
  complainant declare they were acting in good faith (this is one
  of the safe harbour provisions in the DMCA). Not wanting to risk
  the next (fraudulent) step, the researchers stopped there.</p>

  <p>Bits of Freedom organized a similar experiment this summer,
  involving ten Dutch ISPs. They uploaded some text by the famous
  author Multatuli (Eduard Douwes Dekker), dating from 1871. Again,
  their homepage clearly attributed the text and stated that it was
  in the public domain.</p>

  <p>Seven of the ten providers took down the homepage, one within
  3 hours of receiving the fake complaint. Only one provider showed
  any distrust about the origin of the complaint, and only one
  demonstrated that they had actually looked at the page in
  question. In one case, the customer was not even informed of the
  complaint, and in another, the customer's personal details were
  forwarded to the complainant. Two of the ISPs did not reply at
  all to the email sent to their official abuse addresses.</p>

  <p>Nas concludes "It only takes a Hotmail account to bring a
  website down, and freedom of speech stands no chance in front of
  the Texan-style private ISP justice".</p>

  <p>The final talk of the conference was by Peter H. Salus, the
  famous USENIX bookworm. His talk "UNIX and the ARPAnet/Internet
  at 35; Linux a teenager; still in court", gave a historical
  perspective on the SCO Group's attack on Linux through the court
  system. Salus interspersed his many slides of penguin photos with
  copies of legal documents from the SCO Group court cases, giving
  a light-hearted view of the proceedings.</p>

  <p>Throughout the conference, more than a dozen technical posters
  were on display in the lobby: an alternative method for
  authentication, authorization and accounting for Windows 2000/XP
  systems; PPTP must die; CAcert; and more. The prize for best
  poster was awarded to John Borwick of Wake Forest University for
  his poster on "LDAP for Systems and Network Engineering". This
  described a method for storing DNS and DHCP configuration data in
  an LDAP database, and using Perl scripts to retrieve the data and
  generate configuration files.</p>

  <p>There was also a prize for best paper, which was awarded to
  Luca Deri for his paper "Improving Passive Packet Capture: Beyond
  Device Polling". Deri proposes a new approach to passive packet
  capture which, combined with device polling, allows packets to be
  captured and analyzed at (almost) wire speed on Gbit networks
  using a legacy PC.</p>

  <p>After presentation of the prizes and 'thank you's to the many
  volunteers who helped to make the conference run so smoothly,
  Quiz Master Kevlin Henney took over with the inSANE quiz. Two
  teams were drawn "completely at random" from the business cards
  solicited earlier in the day, and pitted against each other and
  the Quiz Master's "completely fair scoring".</p>

  <p>You really had to know your geek culture to do well in this
  quiz - but that alone was not enough. There was audience
  participation too, with each team having to guess how the
  audience would respond to "yellow or green" questions. For
  example, the Quiz Master would shout "Yellow - Python, Green -
  Perl", the teams would have to write down their answers ("yellow"
  or "green") before the audience voted by holding coloured cards
  in the air.</p>

  <p>After one team had been eliminated, the three members of the
  remaining team contended with each other for prizes of books,
  posters and T-shirts. The quiz was a fun way to end a very
  enjoyable conference.</p>

  <p>I was impressed both by the professionalism of the
  organization, the quality of the talks, and the smooth running of
  the event. RAI offered excellent facilities, and the organizers
  had provided wireless networking throughout the conference area,
  as well as a terminal room with Internet access for those of us
  traveling without laptops.</p>

  <p>Congratulations, NLUUG, on another excellent conference! I am
  looking forward already to SANE 2006, and heartily recommend it
  to anyone else with an interest in network or system
  administration. You can find out more about past and future SANE
