      This slim volume contains a wealth of information that will be of
      interest not only to software developers, but to anyone
      responsible for the deployment and operation of computer systems.
      Indeed, if I had one complaint about the book it would be that the
      title is misleading: it is not so much about secure coding as the
      overall software development process, and relatively little is
      said about coding per se. But do not let this put you off,
      programmers will benefit from reading this book too.

      The first chapter gives an overview of security vulnerabilities,
      covering different types of attack; how vulnerabilities arise;
      who might want to exploit them; and how we can defend our
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further chapters cover different aspects of the software
      development process: architecture, design, implementation, and
      testing. Every chapter contains useful information and practical
      advice, and the authors draw on their extensive experience to
      back this up with examples and case studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      They advocate a holistic approach to security: you cannot work
      around design errors at implementation time, and the best design
      and implementation can be laid waste by poor operations
      procedures. This theme permeates the book and is reinforced by
      the chapter on operations, which emphasises the importance of
      providing a secure environment for running a business
      application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most chapters also include sections on good practices and bad
      practices. I found that these conveyed information effectively,
      particularly where they drew attention to failings in my own
      organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book is concise, with clear explanations of new concepts.
      Ideas are further clarified through the case studies, which add
      real-world interest to the book. To top it all, an appendix
      extending to 10 pages lists further resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the prefix, the authors remark that they want the book "...to
      be <strong>read</strong>". They have certainly succeeded in
      producing a very readable volume, and I encourage my fellow
      software developers and systems administrators to go out and
      read it. As for myself, I shall be making time to follow up the
      resources - and putting some of these principles into practice
      on my own systems.
